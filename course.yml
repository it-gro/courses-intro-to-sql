title: Intro to SQL for Data Science
description: "The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights.
  Much of the world's raw data&ndash;from electronic medical records to customer transaction
  histories&ndash;lives in organized collections of tables called <em>relational databases</em>.
  Therefore, to be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract
  data from these databases using a language called SQL (pronounced <em>ess-cue-ell</em>, or
  <em>sequel</em>). This course teaches syntax in SQL shared by many types of databases, 
  such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.This course teaches you everything you 
  need to know to begin working with databases today!"
